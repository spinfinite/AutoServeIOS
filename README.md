Transcript of Demo:

My name is Sergio Perez.  

As a continuation of the WebDevelopment project created to pull vehicles from a government API, I created AutoServe iOS version using XCode and the Swift language.  The intention of this project is to be able to create a list of your favorite vehicle models by selecting the desired make and year.  AutoServe will allow you save your favorite vehicles on your device via CoreData and at the same time delete the models in the SQLite database that you no longer desire.  

Let’s take a look.  

We will use the iPhone 14 simulator and search for the make Acura, a family favorite.  The app will make the request in real time to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s API to get all Makes available.   I will scroll to choose Acura and select the desired year.  One of the coolest things about the app is that it will only display the models available for the year you selected.  For example, let’s choose what many consider one of the top 5 best Acura models of all time, the Acura 2006 RSX.  As you can see, only 5 models were available for this year. I will go ahead and click on RSX to add it to my favorite’s list.

Next, I will add what many consider the number 2 and number 1 best Acura cars of all time.  Two being the 1997 Acura Integra and number 1 being the 1991 Acura NSX.  Let’s click on my favorites tab to see if our 3 vehicles are being saved and displayed on my device.  

Great!  

And just for fun, let’s add a new vehicle, let’s add a 2023 Acura Integra.  Now that we are done, I will click on the favorites tab and see my updated list.  

Since I want to keep it to the classic Acura models, I will delete the 2023 Acura Integra by swiping left and click on the unfavorite button.  The app deletes the vehicle with the animated feature and displays only the vehicles that I want to keep on my phone.  

I loved creating this app and fulfilling a vision that I had to use API’s and saving to CoreData.  The aim now is to make it available in the app store as well as adding additional features to it.  

Thank you for watching!
